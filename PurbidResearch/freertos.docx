RTOS (REAL TIME OPERATING SYTEM)
System requirements:
Large enough in memory size and sufficient power supply
300 bytes of RAM and 1-2kb of flash
Microcontroller(ARM-CORTEX)
Working:
RTOSâ€™s main difference from a normal OS is the priority algorithm to different tasks. Hybrid configuration is used to mage tasks.
Aging to boost the priority of a task waiting for a long time. Algorithms used can be pre-emptive or round robin. Power saving to be implemented by tickless mode.
Tasks can be classified as:
Perdiodic tasks
Periodic Update tasks
Aperiodic tasks
Modules to work on:
Assigning priority to tasks.
Scheduler task assignment.
Handling interrupted tasks.
Controlled power increase/decrease.
Minimizing memory size.(dynamic allocation)
Handling zombie processes.
Error handling of any sort while priority assignment or task execution.  
OS to use/develop:
FreeRTOS.
KubOS
It is an open source platform for satellites. KubOS SDK is all s/w components used to create a KubOS project loaded on endpoint device and then interact with it.
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
64 bit processor with AMD-v or Intel VT-x virtualization.
Recent linux distro
8 GB RAM
10 GB of free HDD space.
Vagrant box
WORKING
Platform provides the developers tools and libraries to build space ready software.
